**PROJECT TITLE:** 2015-Nigerian-Under-5-Nutrition-Health-Survey-Using-Power-BI

**This project features an interactive Power BI dashboard based on the 2015 Nigeria National Nutrition and Health Survey (NNHS), designed to visualise key indicators of child malnutrition across Nigerian states and regions. It highlights metrics such as Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM), MUAC, diarrhoea prevalence, edema, deworming coverage, vitamin A supplementation, and mosquito net usage.

**Project conclusions based on the provided data:**
 

Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) prevalence is highest in the North West (NW) and North East (NE) zones, highlighting a clear regional nutrition disparity. This aligns with known socioeconomic vulnerabilities in these zones.

Stunting (Chronic Malnutrition) Increases with Age.

Analysis shows that stunted growth prevalence rises steadily with age up to 36 months, indicating long-term undernutrition. The pattern also suggests that early intervention is critical. WHO standard values for comparison.

Underweight Rates Outpace Normal Weight Across Age Groups.

Across all age brackets, the number of underweight children surpasses those with normal weight, especially between 12 to 36 months, suggesting systemic nutritional deficiencies during early development.

Low Bilateral Edema but Concerning Diarrhea Rates.

While bilateral edema (a sign of severe malnutrition) is low at 0.27%, diarrhea prevalence is high at 17.63%, indicating poor sanitation and potential for worsening nutrition outcomes if unaddressed.

Deworming Coverage is Below Optimal

Only 16.6% of children were dewormed, falling short of public health goals and pointing to missed opportunities in reducing nutrient loss due to parasitic infections.

 Inequitable Resource Distribution

Mosquito net coverage was disproportionately low in Southeast (SE) and Northwest (NW) despite high malaria risks, suggesting failed public health distribution systems.

 

Data-Driven Recommendations

Targeted SAM interventions in NW/NE zones (therapeutic feeding programs).

Deworming campaigns paired with WASH education to address diarrhoea prevalence.

Net distribution audits in SE/NW to identify supply chain gaps.
